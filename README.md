# Portfolio Questions  
## The Process and Challenges

While creating my portfolio website, likely the biggest challenge that I faced was the successful execution of my styling code. I started by creating each element seperately, trying to make it work properly from the very first build of each piece. However this isn't always successful and parts often don't work properly the first try. The challenge in debugging my code was the amount of time and tweaks that each element demanded to make them work properly. I've learned in creating this portfolio, that the work is often ongoing, and there can be fixes and tweaks being pushed out right until the deadline rolls around. There is always more personal work that can be added to a portfolio, and there will always be elements that can use just a little more personal attention from the developer.
